For three years, I have lived in Burma.  More than anything else, the value of the US Dollar (USD) compared to the value of the local currency, Myanmar Kyat (MMK), has dictated my material possibilities.  As this country does not have effective trade relations with any other nation, and it is illegal to take MMK out of the country, all things must be imported with USD.  For this reason, it is said that the "black" economy is as much as 8 times the size of the formal economy.  

The Central Bank of Myanmar each morning releases the exchange rates on a basis that is perhaps not arbitrary, but is totally unknown.  The mint exists on a military base, and there is no known monetary policy.  As the government cannot effectively levy taxes, the money supply changes constantly.  Some people believe that the exchange rates and money supply are the direct product of astrological guidance from certain high-ranking Buddhist monks.

There is no database of the historical data apart from the website of the Central Bank of Myanmar, so I have scraped it and created my own.  Eventually, I would like to use tensorflow to try to find patterns in this data.  For the scope of this small project, I will only attempt to find out if the data is white noise.  If it is not just random noise, then I believe there will be predictive patterns available.  Following this test, I will attempt to distil a stationary dataset before engaging in statistical analysis with R and Python.
