I live in Burma.  More than anything else, the value of the US Dollar (USD) compared to the value of the local currency, Myanmar Kyat (MMK), dictates my material possibilities.  As this country does not have effective trade relations with any other nation, and it is illegal to take MMK out of the country, all things must be imported with USD.  For this reason, it is said that the "black" economy is as much as 8 times the size of the formal economy.  For importers and Asian banks, knowledge of the exchange rate is extremely important.

The Central Bank of Myanmar each morning releases the exchange rates on a basis that is perhaps not arbitrary, but is totally unknown.  The mint exists on a military base, and there is no known monetary policy.  As the government cannot effectively levy taxes, the money supply changes will-nilly.  Some people believe that the exchange rates and money supply are the direct product of astrological guidance from high-ranking Buddhist monks.

There is no database of the historical data apart from the website of the Central Bank of Myanmar.  I aim to 1) scrape this website, 2) clean this data, and 3) discover via basic tests if this dataset is stationary.  I am fairly certain on theoretical grounds that this dataset is neither white noise nor stationary.  If I am accepted to the program, I will manipulate this dataset further to make it stationary, and begin regular timeseries data analysis.
