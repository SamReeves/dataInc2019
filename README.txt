TDI CHALLENGE PROJECT

-- THIS PROJECT --
The historical data is offered generously by the Central Bank of Myanmar on their website.
I aim to:
1) scrape this website,
2) clean this data,
3) discover what aspects of the data probably contain useful patterns.

If I am accepted, I would like to use TensorFlow to try to make a predictive model on the data.

-- IMAGE 1 -- TDI.png --
This is the history of each traded currency's Trend Detection Index (blue) and Direction Indicator (red), laid end-to-end.  This could mean that ten to fifteen currencies appear to have highly-visible trends, while the rest of the 38 are probably just white noise.

-- IMAGE 2 -- rates.png -- 
This image shows basically the same story as the first.  There is a basket of dominant currencies which has motion, and a silent majority.  All of the active currencies appear to have very closely linked, yet distinct activity.  These currencies would probably offer the greatest possibilities for machine learning.
